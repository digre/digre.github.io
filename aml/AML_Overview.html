<h1>AML</h1>
<p/>
AML defines a standard means for modeling Archetype Models (AMs) to support the
representation of Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) artifacts
using modeling profiles as defined in the UML. Archetype Models are Platform
Independent Models (PIMs) and are developed as a set of constraints on a
specific Reference Model (RM).
